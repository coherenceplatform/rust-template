# rust-template

A starter app for a Rails API with a Vue frontend on Coherence (withcoherence.com)

# Setup

Make a new application on Coherence.

* Be sure to set `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` to `3717046dacbea967518d7bf4b113676f`
* You'll need to edit `backend/config/database.yml` - grab from the `config` tab on the `main` environment on Coherence the ENV variable ending in `_SOCKET` and replace it in the rails config file. Then push that change to your repo.
